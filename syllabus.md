This course is an advanced undergraduate course.  We will examine the
central dimensions of environmental politics and policy in the United
States.

The course will provide an overview of the development of environmental policy issues, including a brief history on the develop of environmental politics in the U.S. In addition, the course will also provide a theoretical base for understanding policy changes in the U. S. Major portions of the course will be devoted to examining the fundamental beliefs and attitudes that
have shaped environmental policies; the major political institutions in the U.S. that conceive, design, implement, and revise environmental policies; the role of science and risk assessment in environmental policy; and the application of economic principles to environmental issues.

The format of the course will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, and group work. Students should come to each class prepared to participate in discussion. This means you have reviewed your notes from previous classes and have read the readings in advance of class. You are encouraged to bring your internet capable device (laptop, tablet, smart--phone) to class for discussion and group work, _however these devices are not to be used in a way that is distracting to your professor or your classmates_
