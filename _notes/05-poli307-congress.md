## Congressional Committees

* _Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst Congress in its committee-rooms is Congress at work_ (Woodrow Wilson 1885)

* Committees assist members of Congress to overcome _imperfect information_ through specialization 

* Committees are divided by policy jurisdiction 
    * Policy jurisdiction: Authority within certain policy domains 

* Committees have 3 types of authority 
    * Gatekeeping: The power to decide if a change in policy will be considered

    * Oversight: The power to oversee the implementation of policies

## Parliamentary Rules

* How a Bill Becomes a Law 

* Debate in the House
    * Bills reported out of committee first go to the Rules Committee, which determines the rules under which the bill will be debated on the floor where the majority rules
    * The Rules Committee may provide
        * A closed rule---prohibits the introduction of amendments
        * An open rule---permits the addition of amendments

## Parliamentary Rules

* How a Bill Becomes a Law 

* Debate in the Senate
    * The Senate has a tradition of unlimited debate
    * It takes three-fifths of the Senate (60 votes) to invoke cloture (end of debate)
    * Filibuster

## Parliamentary Rules

* How a Bill Becomes a Law 

* Reconciling Bills
    * To become a law, a bill must be passed in exactly the same form in both chambers
    * Frequently, the two chambers send the bill back and forth until one
chamber passes a version passed by the other
    * Sometimes, a conference committee is appointed with members from each
chamber to work out differences

## Parliamentary Rules

* How a Bill Becomes a Law 

* Presidential Action
    * The president may veto legislation and Congress may only override the veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber
    * Presidents generally use the threat of a veto to shape legislation and try to avoid the embarrassment of having a veto overridden

## Environmental Laws

## Political Parties

* Members organize themselves into party coalitions in the House and Senate called a caucus (Democrats) or a conference (Republicans)

* Members choose leadership (Speaker, Majority Leader, Minority Leader, Whips)

* Members empower party leaders to influence the agenda and manage legislation
