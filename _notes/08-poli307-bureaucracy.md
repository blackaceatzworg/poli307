## Why Bureaucracy? 

* Bureaucratic organization _enhances efficiency_ through division of labor and specialization

* Bureaucracies _allow governments to operate_ by allowing large--scale coordination of individuals working on a task

* Politics
    * Legislators find it useful to delegate some decisions
    * Legislators sometimes lack expertise or prefer for decisions to be made by "objective" bureaucrats rather than interested politicians

## What Executive Agencies Do

* Implementation: _The efforts of departments and agencies to translate laws into specific bureaucratic routines_ 

* Regulation: _Laws / legal norms that limit behavior_ 

* Rulemaking: A quasi-legislative administrative process that produces regulations
    * Authority comes from laws enacted by Congress; process from _Administrative Procedure Act of 1946_
        * _Pre-proposal_ 
        * Proposed rule 
        * Comment period
        * Final rule
    * Regulatory capture

## Bureaucracy and Principal--Agent Relationship

* Principal---the supplier of policymaking authority delegates to an _agent_---the recipient of policymaking authority 

* Principal--Agent Problem
    * The principal--agent relationship may be affected by the fact that each is motivated by self--interest, yet their interests may not be well aligned 

* Bureaucrats can be understood as agents of elected officials
