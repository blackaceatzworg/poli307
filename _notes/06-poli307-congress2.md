## Dysfunctional Congress (Binder)

* According to Sarah Binder, has the problem-solving capacity of Congress fallen in recent years?

* Studying Congress:
    * _Divided We Govern_ (Mayhew)
    * _Pivotal Politics_ (Krehbiel)
        * Institutions (rules) create important "pivot points"
    * _Setting the Agenda_ (Cox and McCubbins)
        * Majority party leadership key agenda setter
        * Partisan Pivots (Primo et al); _Majority median and filibuster_

* _Congress ... struggles to legislate when partisan polarization rises_ (Binder)

## Party Polarization

* What factors contribute to polarization?
    * [Vote View website](http://voteview.com/index.asp)
    * [The Monkey Cage](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/01/08/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-our-polarized-politics/)
    * Started in the mid--1970s
    * Timing points to post--Civil Rights realignment 
    * Asymmetrical: Republicans moving further to the right
    * Ideology explains more and more of the difference 
    * Voters are better sorted 
    * Gerrymandering and partisan primaries __not__ seen as important causes

* What are some of the causes of environmental policy gridlock?
    * Divergent policy views of the parties
    * Interest group influence
    * Complex environmental problems
    * Lack of clear public consensus
    * "Separate branches sharing power"
    * Ineffectual political leadership

## Party Divergence and Environmental Policy

* According to the Shipan and Lowry article, have Republicans and Democrats grown further apart in the past three decades with regard to environmental policy? Why or why not (discuss some of the arguments made by Shipan and Lowry)?
