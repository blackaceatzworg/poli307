## Courts and the Review of Laws

* Judicial Review: _The power of the courts to declare actions of the legislative and executive branches invalid or unconstitutional_ 
    * NOT explicitly granted to the Court in the Constitution but was asserted by the Court in _Marbury v. Madison_ (1803)

## Sources of Environmental Law

* Statutes (federal, state, and local)

* Executive orders

* Administrative rules and regulations

* _Appellate court decisions_ 

* _Stare decisis_: "let the decision stand"
    * Legal Precedents: Prior cases whose principles are used by judges as the bases for their decisions in present cases

## How Courts Shape Environmental Policy

* Determine standing: the right to sue

* Deciding which cases are "ripe" or ready for review

* Choice of standard of review: high or low deference
    * _Chevron deference_

* Interpretation of laws

* Choice of remedy
