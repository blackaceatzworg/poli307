title: Paper 1 
---

Due in the dropbox on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/) before class on **MM DD**.

Papers will be expected to be the equivalent of 3--4 double spaced pages, with 1" margins, and 12-point Times New Roman font.  Because the papers are short, I will expect well organized,  clear, concise, and professional quality writing. Full and appropriate citations are expected, with any citation style (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago, Harvard) you prefer.  If necessary, consider making use of the [Writing Lab](http://csl.cofc.edu/labs/writing-lab) available on campus. 

### Paper 1 

Describe the basics of your environmental policy issue.  Why is it an important issue? Why is it an interesting issue? What are the primary controversies? What are the major legislation or Supreme Court cases that are associated with your topic area?
